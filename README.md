This Shopware5 extension provides some usefull functions and tools wich every developer needs sometimes.

## Requirements:
* Shopware version >= 5.1.0.
* NetiFoundation >= 1.9.10

## Install:
1. If you haven't already, download and install our free plugin "[NetiFoundation](http://store.shopware.com/detail/index/sArticle/162025)" from the Shopware Community Store
2. Download via Shopware Store, [here](https://github.com/NetInventors/sw.ext.neti_tool_kit/releases/latest) or clone this repository to the
*"engine/Shopware/Plugins/Core"* folder, **remember to name the plugin folder "NetiToolKit"** and install through the Plugin Manager

## Configuration:
> Because some of these Features were moved from the Net Inventors Foundation Plugin the features **UserData**
and **UserLoggedIn** are enabled by default in the Plugin configuration. All other configurations could be enabled in the plugin settings.

## Use:
So far we added following helpers:

### article properties in article listing
You can just access them like in the article details
* e.g. `{$sArticle.sProperties[1].value}`

### UserData
If the user is logged in you can access the user infos on every page
* Accessed in Smarty via `{$netiUserData}`

### UserLoggedIn
Here you can check globally if the user is logged in
* Accessed in Smarty via `{$sUserLoggedIn}`
